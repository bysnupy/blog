# "PLEG is not healthy" deep dive

## Introduction

The PLEG(Pod Lifecycle Event Generator) in kubelet(Kubernetes) convert the container runtime states with each matched pod-level event and maintain the pod cache up-to-date. This PLEG keep watching health state as calling Healty() function periadically. If the relistTime is greater than 3 minutes, "PLEG is not healthy" is shown.

```go
// The threshold needs to be greater than the relisting period + the
// relisting time, which can vary significantly. Set a conservative
// threshold to avoid flipping between healthy and unhealthy.
relistThreshold = 3 * time.Minute
...
// pkg/kubelet/pleg/generic.go
func (g *GenericPLEG) Healthy() (bool, error) {
	relistTime := g.getRelistTime()
	elapsed := g.clock.Since(relistTime)
	if elapsed > relistThreshold {
		return false, fmt.Errorf("pleg was last seen active %v ago; threshold is %v", elapsed, relistThreshold)
	}
	return true, nil
}
```

I'd like to follow the `relist` to examine why "PLEG is unheathy" happen in the process from now.
The `relist` is executed periodically(1s by default) by as follows.
```go
// Start spawns a goroutine to relist periodically.
func (g *GenericPLEG) Start() {
	go wait.Until(g.relist, g.relistPeriod, wait.NeverStop)
}
```

We focus `relist()` to examine as follows in order the main work processes.

```go
// relist queries the container runtime for list of pods/containers, compare
// with the internal pods/containers, and generates events accordingly.
func (g *GenericPLEG) relist() {
	glog.V(5).Infof("GenericPLEG: Relisting")

	if lastRelistTime := g.getRelistTime(); !lastRelistTime.IsZero() {
		metrics.PLEGRelistInterval.Observe(metrics.SinceInMicroseconds(lastRelistTime))
	}

	timestamp := g.clock.Now()
	defer func() {
		metrics.PLEGRelistLatency.Observe(metrics.SinceInMicroseconds(timestamp))
	}()

	// Get all the pods.
	podList, err := g.runtime.GetPods(true)
	if err != nil {
		glog.Errorf("GenericPLEG: Unable to retrieve pods: %v", err)
		return
	}

	g.updateRelistTime(timestamp)

	pods := kubecontainer.Pods(podList)
	g.podRecords.setCurrent(pods)

	// Compare the old and the current pods, and generate events.
	eventsByPodID := map[types.UID][]*PodLifecycleEvent{}
	for pid := range g.podRecords {
		oldPod := g.podRecords.getOld(pid)
		pod := g.podRecords.getCurrent(pid)
		// Get all containers in the old and the new pod.
		allContainers := getContainersFromPods(oldPod, pod)
		for _, container := range allContainers {
			events := computeEvents(oldPod, pod, &container.ID)
			for _, e := range events {
				updateEvents(eventsByPodID, e)
			}
		}
	}

	var needsReinspection map[types.UID]*kubecontainer.Pod
	if g.cacheEnabled() {
		needsReinspection = make(map[types.UID]*kubecontainer.Pod)
	}

	// If there are events associated with a pod, we should update the
	// podCache.
	for pid, events := range eventsByPodID {
		pod := g.podRecords.getCurrent(pid)
		if g.cacheEnabled() {
			// updateCache() will inspect the pod and update the cache. If an
			// error occurs during the inspection, we want PLEG to retry again
			// in the next relist. To achieve this, we do not update the
			// associated podRecord of the pod, so that the change will be
			// detect again in the next relist.
			// TODO: If many pods changed during the same relist period,
			// inspecting the pod and getting the PodStatus to update the cache
			// serially may take a while. We should be aware of this and
			// parallelize if needed.
			if err := g.updateCache(pod, pid); err != nil {
				glog.Errorf("PLEG: Ignoring events for pod %s/%s: %v", pod.Name, pod.Namespace, err)

				// make sure we try to reinspect the pod during the next relisting
				needsReinspection[pid] = pod

				continue
			} else if _, found := g.podsToReinspect[pid]; found {
				// this pod was in the list to reinspect and we did so because it had events, so remove it
				// from the list (we don't want the reinspection code below to inspect it a second time in
				// this relist execution)
				delete(g.podsToReinspect, pid)
			}
		}
		// Update the internal storage and send out the events.
		g.podRecords.update(pid)
		for i := range events {
			// Filter out events that are not reliable and no other components use yet.
			if events[i].Type == ContainerChanged {
				continue
			}
			g.eventChannel <- events[i]
		}
	}

	if g.cacheEnabled() {
		// reinspect any pods that failed inspection during the previous relist
		if len(g.podsToReinspect) > 0 {
			glog.V(5).Infof("GenericPLEG: Reinspecting pods that previously failed inspection")
			for pid, pod := range g.podsToReinspect {
				if err := g.updateCache(pod, pid); err != nil {
					glog.Errorf("PLEG: pod %s/%s failed reinspection: %v", pod.Name, pod.Namespace, err)
					needsReinspection[pid] = pod
				}
			}
		}

		// Update the cache timestamp.  This needs to happen *after*
		// all pods have been properly updated in the cache.
		g.cache.UpdateTime(timestamp)
	}

	// make sure we retain the list of pods that need reinspecting the next time relist is called
	g.podsToReinspect = needsReinspection
}
```

I start to check the processes in order into the `relist()` from now.
`kubelet_pleg_relist_latency_microseconds`(Prometheus metrics) is calculated by the elapsed time for `relist()` as follows.
```go
timestamp := g.clock.Now()
defer func() {
  metrics.PLEGRelistLatency.Observe(metrics.SinceInMicroseconds(timestamp))
}()
```
